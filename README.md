# ðŸ’« About Me:
ðŸŽ“ I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer with a fervent interest in cutting-edge technology.<br><br>

My professional journey encompasses a diverse array of projects in analytics engineering, where I specialize in solving complex challenges within business and healthcare insurance domains. From data understanding to Data Ingestion, and from constructing data warehouses to designing data lakes, I excel in crafting star schemas (facts and dimensions) and conducting thorough data analysis via intuitive dashboards.

Moreover, I have spearheaded numerous projects in NLP engineering, delving deep into generation models. For comprehensive insights into my projects and solutions, I invite you to explore the NLP project section.

Furthermore, my expertise extends to various projects in the realm of machine learning, encompassing both supervised and unsupervised problems. Additionally, I have undertaken several ventures in computer vision, demonstrating a multifaceted skill set.

For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.

## Analytics Engineering Projects 

* ### [Airbnb](https://github.com/amal572/Airbnb_platforms_data_engenering.git)

  	Airbnb's project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts Airbnb prices in some of the most popular European cities from Kaggle. Each listing is evaluated for various attributes such as room types, cleanliness 
            and satisfaction ratings, bedrooms, distance from the city center, and more to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on both weekdays and weekends.

## application Projects with AI

* ### [Movie Recommendation Website](https://github.com/amal572/movies-search.git)

  	This website is dedicated to recommending movies to users based on various recommendation system techniques, including content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches. Users can discover new movies tailored to their 
    preferences and interests through these recommendation methods. Additionally, the website provides a search feature where users can input descriptions or details of movies they are interested in, and the system will find relevant 
    recommendations based on the input.

## Machine learning Projects

* ### [Credit Card Clustering](https://github.com/amal572/Credit-Card-Clustering.git)

  	This project is unsupervised and aims to cluster credit cards based on customer-level data containing 18 behavioral variables, to define an effective marketing strategy. Techniques such as PCA, Kmeans, Agglomerative 
            hierarchy, Gaussian Mixture, and Clustering with PyCaret are utilized for credit card clustering.

* ### [Diamond-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/amal572/Diamond-Price-Prediction.git)

  	This project is a regression problem that aims to predict the price of diamonds by training multiple models and determining the optimal performance score.
  
* ### [Music_Genre_Classification](https://github.com/amal572/Music_Genre_Classification.git)

  	This project is a classification problem that aims to predict the class by training multiple classification models and determining the optimal performance score.

## Fuzzy Projects

* ### [FuzzyClust Image Enhancement](https://github.com/amal572/FuzzyClust-Image-Enhancement.git)
 
    the task in the project is image enhancement, which is a preprocessing step in digital image processing. Image enhancement techniques aim to improve the appearance or perception of an image, making it suitable for analysis and human      visual systems. By enhancing images, we can enhance details, improve contrast, reduce noise, and overall, make the images more visually appealing and informative.

* ### [Water Control System](https://github.com/amal572/Water-Control-System.git)
  
    The proposed palm tree irrigation control system from Al company is a multifaceted model that combines fuzzy logic technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing techniques. Data is collected from temperature and 
    soil moisture sensors, then the Fuzzy Logic system determines the correct amount of water the pump should supply to the palm trees.
